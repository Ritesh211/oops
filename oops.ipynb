        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        ">Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\" to design applications and computer programs.\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        ">In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the common structure and behavior that its objects will possess.\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        ">In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class serves as a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the common structure and behavior that its objects will possess.\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        ">Abstraction and encapsulation are fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming, often confused but distinct in their focus and purpose.\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and presenting only the essential features or functionalities to the user. It answers the question of \"what\" an object does, rather than \"how\" it does it. Abstraction simplifies complex systems by providing a high-level view and allowing users to interact with objects based on their defined behavior without needing to understand the underlying mechanics. This is often achieved through abstract classes and interfaces in programming languages.\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are methods in Python classes that are distinguished by having double underscores at both the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__).\n",
        "6.Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "> Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept that allows a new class, known as the child class (or subclass, derived class), to inherit properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) from an existing class, known as the parent class (or superclass, base class).\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "> Polymorphism in object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type, enabling flexibility and code reusability. Essentially, it means that a single function or method can behave differently based on the object it's acting upon.\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python ?\n",
        ">Encapsulation in Python, a core principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), is achieved by bundling data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data within a single unit, typically a class, and controlling access to these components. While Python does not enforce strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected keywords found in other languages (e.g., Java, C++), it uses naming conventions and mechanisms to achieve a similar effect.\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        ">In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object of a class. It is automatically called when an object of the class is instantiated.\n",
        "Key characteristics of a Python constructor:\n",
        "Name:\n",
        "The constructor method in Python is always named __init__. This is a special method name recognized by Python.\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Its primary purpose is to set up the initial state of the object. This involves assigning values to the object's attributes (instance variables) or performing any other setup logic required for the object to be ready for use.\n",
        "Automatic Invocation:\n",
        "Unlike regular methods that must be explicitly called, the __init__ method is automatically invoked by Python when an object of the class is created.\n",
        "self parameter:\n",
        "The first parameter of the __init__ method is always self. This parameter refers to the instance of the object being created, allowing you to access and modify its attributes.\n",
        "Parameters:\n",
        "Constructors can accept additional parameters beyond self to receive initial values for the object's attributes.\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python\n",
        "> In Python, both class methods and static methods are defined within a class but differ in their access to class and instance data, and how they are invoked.\n",
        "Class Methods:\n",
        "Purpose:\n",
        "Class methods are used for operations that involve the class itself, rather than specific instances of the class. They can access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "Decorator:\n",
        "Defined using the @classmethod decorator.\n",
        "Parameter:\n",
        "They take cls (conventionally named) as their first parameter, which refers to the class object itself. This allows them to access and modify class variables or call other class methods.\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Common for factory methods that create new instances of the class, or for methods that operate on class-level data.\n",
        "11.  What is method overloading in Python\n",
        "> Method overloading, in the context of programming, refers to the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but have different parameter lists (i.e., different numbers or types of arguments). This allows a single method name to perform different operations based on the arguments provided.\n",
        " 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        " >Method overloading, in the context of object-oriented programming, refers to the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but differ in their parameters (either in number or type). This allows a single method name to perform different actions based on the arguments it receives.\n",
        " 13. What is a property decorator in Python\n",
        " > In Python, the @property decorator is a built-in decorator used to define managed attributes within a class. It allows you to treat a method as an attribute, providing a more \"Pythonic\" way to implement getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes without directly calling methods.\n",
        " 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP\n",
        " > Polymorphism is crucial in object-oriented programming (OOP) because it allows for flexibility, code reuse, and maintainability by enabling objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type\n",
        " 15. What is an abstract class in Python\n",
        " > An abstract class in Python is a class that serves as a blueprint or template for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of an abstract class. Its primary purpose is to define a common interface and enforce specific methods that must be implemented by any concrete (non-abstract) class that inherits from it.\n",
        " 16. What are the advantages of OOP\n",
        " > Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several advantages, including improved code organization, reusability, maintainability, and scalability. It achieves this by breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable objects that encapsulate data and behavior. This modular approach simplifies development, testing, and debugging processes.\n",
        " 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable\n",
        " > The fundamental difference between a class variable and an instance variable lies in their scope, storage, and how they are accessed and shared among objects of a class.\n",
        "Class Variables:\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "Class variables are declared directly within the class definition, but outside of any methods. In some languages like Java, they are often declared with the static keyword.\n",
        "Scope & Sharing:\n",
        "They belong to the class itself and are shared by all instances (objects) of that class. There is only one copy of a class variable, regardless of how many instances are created.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "Class variables can be accessed using the class name directly (e.g., ClassName.variable_name) or through an instance of the class.\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Ideal for storing data that is common to all instances, such as constants, configuration settings, or counters that track the number of instances created.\n",
        "Instance Variables:\n",
        "Definition:\n",
        "Instance variables are declared within a class but are associated with individual instances of that class. In Python, they are typically defined within the __init__ method using self.variable_name.\n",
        "Scope & Sharing:\n",
        "Each instance of a class has its own unique copy of instance variables. Changes to an instance variable in one object do not affect the same variable in other objects.\n",
        "Access:\n",
        "Instance variables are accessed through an instance of the class (e.g., object_name.variable_name).\n",
        "Use Cases:\n",
        "Used to store data that is unique to each specific object, representing its individual state or characteristics.\n",
        "In summary: Class variables are shared across all instances, while instance variables are unique to each instance. This distinction is crucial for designing object-oriented programs where data needs to be either common to all objects or specific to individual objects.\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "> Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent (or base) class. This means a single child class can combine the functionalities and characteristics of multiple distinct parent classes.\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python\n",
        "> In Python, __str__ and __repr__ are special methods (also known as \"dunder methods\") used to define how an object is represented as a string. They serve different purposes and are intended for different audiences.\n",
        "__str__ (for \"string\"): This method returns a \"user-friendly\" or \"readable\" string representation of an object. Its primary purpose is to provide a human-readable output, suitable for display to end-users, logging, or printing. When you use print() or str() on an object, Python typically calls its __str__ method.\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python\n",
        "> The super() function in Python holds significant importance in the context of object-oriented programming, particularly concerning inheritance. Its primary significance lies in providing a mechanism to access methods and attributes of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass.\n",
        " 21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        " >The super() function in Python holds significant importance in the context of object-oriented programming, particularly concerning inheritance. Its primary significance lies in providing a mechanism to access methods and attributes of a parent or superclass from a child or subclass.\n",
        " 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python\n",
        " > @staticmethod\n",
        "No implicit first argument:\n",
        "A static method does not receive the instance (self) or the class (cls) as its first argument. It behaves like a regular function that is logically grouped within a class.\n",
        "No access to class or instance state:\n",
        "It cannot directly access or modify class-level attributes or instance-level attributes.\n",
        "Use case:\n",
        "Ideal for utility functions that belong conceptually to a class but do not require any class-specific or instance-specific data. For example, a method to validate a date format within a DateUtility class.\n",
        "@classmethod\n",
        "Implicit first argument cls: A class method receives the class itself (cls) as its first argument, allowing it to access and modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "Access to class state: It can access and modify class variables and call other class methods.\n",
        "Use case: Commonly used for factory methods that create instances of the class, or for methods that operate on class-level data. For example, a from_string method in a Person class that creates a Person object from a string representation.\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance\n",
        "> Polymorphism in Python, particularly in conjunction with inheritance, allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This is achieved primarily through method overriding.\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "Inheritance:\n",
        "A parent class (superclass) defines a method. Child classes (subclasses) inherit this method.\n",
        "Method Overriding:\n",
        "A child class can provide its own specific implementation for a method that it inherited from its parent class. This means the child class \"overrides\" the parent's method with its own version.\n",
        "Dynamic Binding:\n",
        "When you call a method on an object, Python determines which implementation of that method to use at runtime based on the actual type of the object, not just the type of the variable holding the object. If the object's class has overridden the method, that overridden version is executed. Otherwise, the inherited method from the parent class is used.\n",
        "24.  What is method chaining in Python OOP\n",
        "> Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique that allows for the sequential invocation of multiple methods on the same object within a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (typically self) after performing its action.\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python\n",
        "> The __call__ method in Python allows instances of a class to be invoked or called as if they were regular functions. When this method is defined within a class, calling an object of that class (e.g., my_object()) automatically triggers the execution of the __call__ method.\n",
